### USAGE

The following video is a bit outdated, but it does go over the use and configuration of Puppy Reinforcement (including a number of other add-ons that help gamify Anki):

### FEATURES (compared to similar add-ons)

- Uses tooltips instead of a separate window
- The puppies are spread intermittently through your reviews. By default they will appear around every 10 cards (some take longer than others). You can customize this by editing the add-on)
- Customizable encouragement messages that change based on the card tally
- Removed cats and other non-puppies

### CONFIGURATION

You can customize Puppy Reinforcement by heading to *Tools* → *Add-ons* , selecting *Puppy Reinforcement*, and then clicking on *Config*. Please note that you might have to restart Anki for some of the options to apply.
